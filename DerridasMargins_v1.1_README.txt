Background
==========

Motivations and Purposes
------------------------

* Overview
  > Derrida’s Margins <derridas-margins.princeton.edu> is a website and online research tool for annotations from the Library of Jacques Derrida, housed at Princeton University Library (PUL) <library.princeton.edu>. Jacques Derrida is one of the major figures of twentieth-century thought, and his library--which bears the traces of decades of close reading--represents a major intellectual archive. This project focused on annotations related to Derrida’s landmark 1967 work De la grammatologie (Of Grammatology).


Methodological Information
--------------------------

* Data collection methods
  > Works cited by Derrida in De la grammatologie were documented in a private Zotero library using a custom tagging system to indicate the location and kind of references in a particular work. That data was imported by script into a custom database, creating records for books, sections of books, and journal articles. Records were also created for references in De la grammatologie based on information encoded in the Zotero tags. The book and reference data was further cleaned and refined in the database after import; items with digital editions available from PUL were linked via IIIF. Interventions were documented by project researchers using a custom-built annotation solution, linked to digitized page images from PUL digital editions for this collection.

* Software-specific information:
  > All files in this collection are given in open formats, so no specialty software is needed to use them.

Data and File Overview
======================

Summary Metrics
---------------

* File count: 136
* Total file size: 1.9 MB
* Range of individual file sizes: 8 kB - 200 kB
* File formats: TXT, CSV

Naming Conventions
------------------

* Folder naming scheme:
  * Parent folders are named according to politicians
  * Child folders are named according to the poets/writers with whom a given politician correspondend

* File naming scheme:
  * Every file starts with the project name, and underscores are used to delimit name fields
  * The top-level files are then named by their simple content: README or TextCatalog
  * The text files are then named by their unique ID number, politician-author link, and approximate date
    * e.g., MockDHProject_0001_Politician-01-Poet-01_1934-03.txt

Setup
-----

* Relationships between files/folders:
  > The correspondences sent to/from some poets and writers are spread across subfolders within the relevant politicians' folders. However, the folder structure is not strictly necessary to keep all of the files organized, as the names of both parties to correspondence are included in file names, and each file name includes a unique text ID. Furthermore, the text catalogue file identifies all texts by their file names and several fields of metadata which may be used to sort and filter the files in various ways.

* Recommendations for integration with other datasets:
  > This version is stand-alone and inclusive of all materials provided in prior versions, so there is no need to attempt to integrate the files of this project at present. The creators are not aware of other datasets which would supplement this dataset in any direct way.
